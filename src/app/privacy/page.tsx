      <LegalSection title="Why we use information">
        <p>
          We process information to provide accounts, live tracking, flight
          history, community submissions, subscriptions, support, abuse
          prevention, security, and service diagnostics. Our legal bases are
          performance of our contract with you, our legitimate interests in
          operating and securing RadarThing, compliance with legal obligations,
          and consent where required for analytics or advertising storage.

      <LegalSection title="Service providers and sharing">
        <p>
          We use Clerk for authentication, Convex for application data,
          UploadThing for uploaded files, Stripe for payments, Resend for
          transactional email, PostHog for optional analytics, and Google
          AdSense for free-tier advertising. These providers process information
          under their own terms and may process it outside the United Kingdom;
          we rely on applicable contractual and legal transfer safeguards.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also disclose information where legally required, to protect
          users or the service, or as part of a business transfer. We do not
          sell account information directly.

          Account and flight data is retained while your account is active or

          submissions remain until removed or replaced. Transaction records are
          kept as needed for accounting and legal obligations. Security and
          diagnostic records are retained only for as long as reasonably needed
          for those purposes. Provider retention periods may also apply.
